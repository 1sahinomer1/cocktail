# Cocktail App
I made an application that shows the cocktails with their recipes.


I made this project to use a router but i learned more.
I used <a href="www.thecocktaildb.com">cocktail</a> for api.
<a href="https://cocktail-roan.vercel.app">Live </a>


# Things i have used on this project for the first time:
 
 -React Routers/Suspense
 -Debounce
 -useParams
 -animations for framer-motion
